* I'm a professional **software developer** (aka computer programmer) with nearly 20 years experience.
  I've worked with many programming languages in my time, but these days I work mostly with
  [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) and [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/).

* I am a **Principal Software Developer** at [Virtual Hold Technology (VHT)](http://www.virtualhold.com/)
  where I lead the new product team, building next-generation contact center and customer care solutions.

* I created [concurrent-ruby](http://www.concurrent-ruby.com), an **open source** project
  providing modern concurrency tools, such as actors agents, futures, promises, thread pools,
  supervisors, and more to the Ruby programming language.

* I am an organizer of the [AkronCodeClub](http://www.meetup.com/AkronCodeClub/), a monthly
  meetup group promoting **agile software development**, **software craftsmanship**, and professional
  ethics. I am also a regular attendee and occasional speaker in the
  [Cleveland Ruby Brigade (CleRB)](http://www.meetup.com/ClevelandRuby/).

* I'm a proud **veteran** of the [United States Navy](http://www.navy.mil/) where I served as a
  [Quartermaster](http://www.public.navy.mil/bupers-npc/enlisted/community/surface_cs_ops/Pages/QM.aspx)
  on the (now decommissioned) [USS Duluth (LPD-6)](http://www.ussduluth.org/).

* I am passionate about **civic engagement**. I lead the software development team that built
  [The Civic Commons](http://theciviccommons.com/), I participate in
  [Code for Summit County](http://codeforsummitcounty.org/), and I am a gratuate of
  [Cleveland Bridge Builders](http://www.cleveleads.org/CLC-BridgeBuilders), a civic leadership
  program of the [Cleveland Leadership Center](http://www.cleveleads.org/).

* I am a regular **conference speaker**, having presented at [RubyConf](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2872-rubyconf2013-advanced-concurrent-programming-in-ruby),
  [Cascadia Ruby](http://www.confreaks.com/videos/2790-cascadiaruby2013-advanced-multithreading-in-ruby),
  [CodeMash](http://www.codemash.org/), and [Stir Trek](http://stirtrek.com/).

* I proudly live in [Akron, OH](http://www.akronohio.gov/) where I do what I can to keep
  **Northeast Ohio** such a great place to live.

* I am **Catholic** and a member of [Saint Sebastian Parish](http://www.stsebastian.org/) where I lector,
  serve on the Finance Committee, and am a member of the Pre-Cana team.

* I love to **travel** and have visited almost 30 countries.
